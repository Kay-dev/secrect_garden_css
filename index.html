            <h2>Inspired by Nature</h2>
            <p>
                Secret Garden made history by winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1995 with “Nocturne”, an entry that
                was more an instrumental piece than a song. In the 40 year history of this prestigious pan-European
                television extravaganza, an instrumental piece had never previously won. A piece so stylistically
                removed from the “European pop format” commonly associated with the song contest, that the press stated:
                “Secret Garden has redefined the Eurovision Song Contest”.

                <h3>Fionnuala Sherry.</h3>
                <p>Fionnuala grew up and went to school in Naas in County Kildare, Ireland – surrounded by a musical
                    family that ignited her passion for music at an early age. She started to play the violin at the age
                    of eight, and at fifteen she moved to Dublin to study music. She graduated with honors from Trinity
                    College in Dublin, and the College of Music, and was later employed by the RTE Concert Orchestra,
                    where she was a member for ten years.</p>
                <p>In addition to the classical symphonic and operatic repertoire, Fionnuala possessed a much wider
                    musical interest. This is evident in the eclectic body of artists and projects she has been involved
                    with, including The Chieftains, Sinead O’Connor, Van Morrison, Chris de Burgh, Bono, and Wet Wet
                    Wet. With the Irish Film Orchestra, she’s also recorded several Hollywood film scores, such as “The
                    River Runs Wild”, “A Room With a View” and “The Mask”.</p>

                <h3>Rolf Løvland.</h3>

                <p>Rolf was born in Kristiansand, in southern Norway, in 1955. His first brush with composing came at
                    the early age of nine when he formed his first band. From then on, and throughout his youth, music
                    came to be his constant companion and focus in life. He later studied music at the Music
                    Conservatory in Kristiansand – and continued his Masters Degree studies in music at the Norwegian
                    Institute of Music in Oslo.</p>
                <p>By the time he’d unveiled his “Secret Garden” to the world, Rolf had already earned himself a
                    Norwegian Grammy Award and the reputation as Norway’s most successful popular songwriter – topping
                    the national radio charts (Norsktoppen) more than 60 times. For two consecutive years, his songs had
                    won the National radio chart “Song of the Year-award”.</p>
